# Lung-Image-Analysis

AI-driven interpretation of chest X-rays for early detection and classification of respiratory infections into Covid-19 or Pneumonia

## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of lung X-ray images into healthy or unhealthy categories. Furthermore, it distinguishes between unhealthy images, categorizing them as either pneumonia or COVID-19 cases. The classifier employs deep learning techniques for image analysis and classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the classifier consists of a collection of lung X-ray images sourced from various publicly available repositories. It includes images of healthy lungs, lungs affected by pneumonia, and lungs affected by COVID-19.
